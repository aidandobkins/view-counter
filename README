This program counts all the views from a given list of youtube URLs. The intended use was to be able to total all of the views from my previously edited
videos. 

In order to run this program, include a "key.txt" file with your Youtube Developer API key, and a text file "videourls.txt" with all of the 
youtube URLs, seperated by a line break between each URL.

After this, simply click the button and wait for the views to be tallied.
